# minimax

Minimax is an algorithm used to make decisions in games where an opponent has the opposite goal as the player. It was used historically to play&mdash;and win at&mdash;Chess. I am going to be using it to implement a Checkers AI. Checkers is probably a bad example, since there are simpler algorithms for it, but nevertheless I think it will help me learn about minimax.

# Enhancements

This version of Minimax will include the Alpha/Beta technique and iterative deepening.
