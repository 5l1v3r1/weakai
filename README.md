I have begun watching some of [MIT's OpenCourseware AI lectures](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/). In this repository, I will attempt to implement what I've learned.

# What's included

Here are the weak AI demos I've implemented:

 * [minimax](minimax) - checkers AI that uses the minimax algorithm. This is an HTML+CSS+SVG+JavaScript application for Desktops&mdash;it does not support touch screens.
 * [neuralnets](neuralnets) - an implementation of basic neural networks with back-propagation. I wrote two tests for the neural net, the second of which demonstrates ANNs' ability to generalize what they've learned.
